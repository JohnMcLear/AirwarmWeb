/**
 * AIRWARM — enquiry form endpoint
 * =============================================================================
 * Receives the Home Energy Assessment enquiry form and e-mails it to Airwarm.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * A Google Apps Script web app. It runs inside the Airwarm Google Workspace
 * account, receives the form POST, and sends one e-mail. That is all it does.
 *
 * WHY THIS RATHER THAN A FORM SERVICE
 * The privacy policy at /privacy/ says the form "sends us an e-mail and
 * nothing else. There is no database, no customer relationship system and no
 * third-party dashboard holding a list of enquiries."
 *
 * That sentence is only true if the receiving end keeps no copy. A hosted form
 * service stores every submission in its own dashboard, which would make it a
 * processor under UK GDPR — it would have to be named in the policy, given a
 * data-processing agreement, and included in any deletion request. Running it
 * here keeps the enquiry inside Google Workspace, which the policy ALREADY
 * names as Airwarm's processor. No new vendor, no policy change.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO PROTECT
 * Do not add storage. No Sheet, no Drive file, no Properties entry, no
 * console.log of the payload. The moment this writes an enquiry anywhere
 * other than the outbound e-mail, the privacy policy becomes false and has to
 * be rewritten before the change ships.
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT
 * See endpoint/README.md in this repository.
 * =============================================================================
