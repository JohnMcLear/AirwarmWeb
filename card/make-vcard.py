Generates card/airwarm.vcf — the Airwarm contact card served at
https://airwarm.co.uk/card/airwarm.vcf and programmed into the physical NFC
cards.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 card/make-vcard.py

Needs cairosvg to rasterise the Hero Mark. If it is not installed:

    uv run --with cairosvg python3 card/make-vcard.py

See card/README.md before changing anything here — in particular the note about
why this URL must never move.
